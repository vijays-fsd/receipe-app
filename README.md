# Recipes App

Welcome to the **Recipes App**! This is a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to help you manage your favorite recipes. Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**, this application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, offering a RESTful API for efficient recipe management. Additionally, we utilize **Postman** for API testing and documentation.

## Features

- **Create Recipes**: Effortlessly add new recipes to your collection.
- **Retrieve Recipes**: Access all recipes or get details of a specific recipe by its unique ID.
- **Update Recipes**: Modify existing recipes to keep your collection fresh.
- **Delete Recipes**: Remove recipes you no longer need from the database.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Complete support for all CRUD operations, ensuring comprehensive recipe management.
- **MVC Architecture**: Maintains organized code with clear separation of concerns between models, views, and controllers.
- **Robust Error Handling & Validation**: Ensures smooth API operations with effective error management and input validation.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side application development.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for efficient storage and management of recipe data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that simplifies interactions with MongoDB.
